# Economic Indicators for Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

This document outlines the economic indicators that can be integrated with the TRREB real estate data to improve the accuracy and contextual awareness of housing price prediction models. Economic factors have significant influence on real estate markets and provide valuable macroeconomic context that complements transaction-level data.

## Recommended Economic Indicators

|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Bank of Canada Overnight Rate | The primary interest rate set by the central bank | Monthly | Directly affects variable mortgage rates |
| 5-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates | The most common mortgage term in Canada | Weekly/Monthly | Direct impact on housing affordability |
| Variable Mortgage Rates | Rates that fluctuate with the prime rate | Weekly/Monthly | Growing segment of the mortgage market |
| Prime Rate | The base rate banks use to set interest rates for loans | Monthly | Reference point for variable mortgages |

### 5. Construction and Housing Supply

Supply-side indicators help predict market balance and price pressures.

| Indicator | Description | Frequency | Relevance |

### 6. Income and Affordability

Income levels constrain how much buyers can afford to pay for housing.

### 7. Real Estate Investment

Investment activity provides insight into market confidence and external pressures.

| Indicator | Description | Frequency | Relevance |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Data Frequency Alignment

Many economic indicators are published monthly, which aligns well with the TRREB data. However, some important metrics (like income data) may only be available quarterly or annually. Consider:

- Interpolation techniques for lower-frequency data
- Using the most recent available data point for each month
- Creating features that represent "time since last change" for rarely updated indicators

### 2. Temporal Relationships

Economic changes typically affect housing markets with a lag. Consider creating features with various time shifts:

- Concurrent values (same month)
- Lagged values (1-12 months prior)
- Moving averages (3, 6, 12-month rolling windows)
- Year-over-year change rates

### 3. Geographic Granularity

Match economic indicators to the appropriate geographic level when possible:

| Level | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| National | Bank of Canada rate, immigration levels |
| Provincial | Ontario unemployment rate, provincial GDP |
| Regional | GTA-specific metrics, regional employment |
| Municipal | City-level building permits, local population |

### 4. Feature Engineering Ideas

Create derived features that capture economic relationships:

- Price-to-income ratios by region
- Mortgage payment affordability index (using interest rates and income)
- Supply-demand balance indicators
- Housing investment as percentage of GDP
- Spread between fixed and variable mortgage rates

### 5. Data Pipeline Integration

Incorporate economic data collection into the existing pipeline:

1. Create a separate module for economic data acquisition
2. Implement scheduled updates for indicators (many are released on fixed schedules)
3. Build a unified dataset that joins TRREB data with economic indicators on date/time keys
4. Document the provenance and update frequency of each indicator

## Model Enhancement Strategy

When integrating economic indicators with the TRREB data for modeling:

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Establish a baseline model using only TRREB data, then measure improvement when adding economic factors

2. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determine which economic indicators provide the most predictive power

3. **Regional Sensitivity**: Analyze how different regions respond to economic changes (some may be more sensitive to interest rates, others to employment)

4. **Scenario Testing**: Use economic indicators to simulate market scenarios (rising rates, economic downturn, population surge)

5. **Multivariate Time Series Modeling**: Explore models that specifically handle complex temporal relationships between economic factors and housing prices
