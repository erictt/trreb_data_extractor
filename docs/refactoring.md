## Motivation

The original codebase was functional but organized as flat scripts with significant code duplication, limited error handling, and no clear separation of concerns. The refactoring aimed to create a production-quality codebase that would be:

1. More maintainable and extensible
2. Better organized with clear separation of concerns
3. More robust with proper error handling and validation
4. Ready for ML model integration
5. Properly packaged for distribution and reuse

## Original Structure

The original project structure was flat with several Python scripts:

```
trreb_data_extractor/
├── download_trreb_pdfs.py      # Downloads PDFs from TRREB website
├── all_home_detached_extract.py # Extracts specific pages from PDFs
├── extract_prior_to_2020_01.py  # Processes older reports
├── extract_after_2020_01.py     # Processes newer reports using AI
├── setup.sh                    # Setup script
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
├── .env                        # API key configuration
├── pdfs/                       # Downloaded PDFs
├── extracted_data/             # Extracted PDF pages
│   ├── all_home_types/
│   └── detached/
└── csv_data/                   # Processed CSV files
    ├── all_home_types/
    └── detached/
```

This structure had several limitations:
- No clear object-oriented design or class hierarchy
- Code duplication across files
- Limited error handling
- No standardized configuration
- No data validation or normalization
- No integration with economic indicators
- No clear path to ML model development

## New Structure

The refactored project structure follows Python packaging best practices:

```
